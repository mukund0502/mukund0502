## About Me
Hello there! üë®‚Äçüíª I'm Mukund, an AI and Machine Learning enthusiast, currently spearheading innovative developments at TCS. With a solid foundation laid during my graduation from NIT Patna, where I achieved a commendable CGPA of 8.51, I've embarked on an exhilarating journey into the realms of AI, ML, Gen AI, Agentic AI.


## Interests and Expertise
My primary interests lie in the fascinating domains of:

* Machine Learning Engineering ü§ñ
* Artificial Intelligence üß†
* Software Development üöÄ

## Experience 
### AI ML Engineer at TCS
*   Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Flask, integrating an extractor, context finder, and OpenAI LLM endpoint.
*  Created high quality screen recorder 
*  Developed Pipeline for creating dynamic Agents as per the user requirement from the prompts using LangGraph and Autogen framework.


### AI ML Engineer at Telesoft
*  Developed python app with FastAPI and VoIP to handle incoming calls, sending them to a server for processing, and
    responding with AI-generated replies
*  Implemented Automatic speech Recognition, intent detection, slot filling and Text to speech for incoming voice
call and reply with AI generated audio reply.


## Personal Projects
### [Ask From Doc (RAG Application)](https://github.com/mukund0502/ask-from-doc-demo)
* Description: An ask-from-doc application lets users upload documents and ask questions in natural language. It quickly reads the document and provides precise answers by extracting relevant information, making it easy to find specific content without manual searching.
* Technologies Used: OpenAI, OpenAI Embedding, Azure, ChromaDB, Python, GenAI, Streamlit.

### [Text to text generation using *Generative adversarial network*](https://github.com/mukund0502/text2text_GAN)
* Description: Used comditional GAN for data augmentation to reduce biasness of the dataset.
* Technologies Used: Python, NLP, Tensorflow, GloVe, CNN, Numpy.

### [Sudoku Solver using image  processing](https://github.com/mukund0502/SudokuSolver)
* Description: Solve sudoku by scanning the image of sudoku.
* Technologies Used: Flask, CNN, CV2, Computer vision, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tensorflow.
